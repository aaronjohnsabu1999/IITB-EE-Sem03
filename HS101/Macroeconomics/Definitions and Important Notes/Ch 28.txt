Natural Rate of Unemployment = the amount of unemployment that the economy normally experiences = the normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates
Cyclical Unemployment = the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate, being closely associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity = the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate
A person is considered employed if he or she spent most of the previous week working at a paid job.
A person is unemployed if he or she is on temporary layoff, is looking for a job, or is waiting for the start date of a new job.
A person who fits neither of the first two categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker or retiree, is not in the labour force.
Labour Force = the total number of workers, including both the employed and the unemployed
Unemployment Rate = the percentage of the labour force that is unemployed = ((Number of Unemployed)/(Labour Force))*(100%)
Labour-Force Participation Rate = the percentage of the adult population that is in the labour force = ((Labour Force)/(Adult Population))*(100%)
Discouraged Workers = individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job
Most spells of unemployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.
Friction Unemployment = unemployment that results because it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills
Structural Unemployment = unemployment that results because the number of jobs available in some labour markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who wants one
Job Search = the process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills
Unemployment Insurance = a government programme that partially protects workers' incomes when become unemployed
Union = a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions
Collective Bargaining = the process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment
Strike = the organised withdrawal of labour from a firm by a union
Efficiency Wages = above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity
