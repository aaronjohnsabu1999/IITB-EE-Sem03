Financial System = the group of institutions in the economy that help to match one person's saving with another person's investment
Financial Market = financial institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers = Bond Market + Stock Market
Bond = a certificate of indebtedness that specifies the obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond
Date of Maturity = the time at which the loan will be repaid
Term of Bond = the length of time until the bond matures
Perpetuity = a bond that never matures - pays interest forever but the principal is never repaid
Credit Risk = the probability that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal
Default = a failure to pay - possible via bankruptcy
Junk Bonds = bonds issued by financially shaky corporations, which pay very high interest rates
Tax Treatment = the way in which tax laws treat the interest earned on the bond
Stock = a claim to partial ownership in a firm
Equity Finance = the sale of stock to raise money
Debt Finance = the sale of bonds
NASDAQ = National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system
Stock Index = an average of a group of stock prices
Financial Intermediaries = financial institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers = Banks + Mutual Funds
Mutual Fund = an institution that sells shares to the public and uses the proceeds to biu a portfolio of stocks and bonds
GDP, Y = C + I + G + NX; C = Consumption, I = Investment, G = Government Purchases, NX = Net Exports
Closed Economy = an economy that does not interact with other economies
Open Economy = an economy that interacts with other economies around the world
For a closed economy, Y = C + I + G
National Savings, S = Y - C - G = I; Savings = Investments (in a closed economy) --> S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G) = (Private Savings) + (Public Savings)
Private Savings = the income that households have left after paying for taxes and consumptions = Y - T - C
Public Savings = the tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending = T - G
T > G --> Government runs a budget surplus; T < G --> Gorvernment runs a budget deficit
Budget Surplus = an excess of tax revenue over government spending
Budget Deficit = a shortfall of tax revenue from government spending
Market for Loanable Funds = the market in which those who want to save supply funds and those who want to borrow to invest demand funds
If the interest rate were lower than the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity of loanable funds demanded. The resulting shortage of loanable funds would encourage lenders to raise the interest rate they charge.
If a change in the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest rates and greater investment.
If a change in the tax oaws encouraged greater investment, the result would be higher income rates and greater saving.
Crowding Out = a decrease in investment that results from govrtnmrnt borrowing
A budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate and stimulates investment.
