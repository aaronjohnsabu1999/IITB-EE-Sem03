A competitor firm is a price taker whereas a monopoly firm is a price maker.
Monopoly = a firm that is the sole seller of a product without close substitutes, the fundamental cause being barriers to entry
Barriers to Entry:
	1. A key resource is owned by a single firm.
	2. The government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce some good or service.
	3. The costs of production make a single producer more efficient than a large number of producers.
