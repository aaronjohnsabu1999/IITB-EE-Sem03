Elasticity = a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to one of its determinants
Price Elasticity of Demand = a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price
Factors affecting Elasticity
	1. Necessities vs Luxuries
	2. Availability of Close Substitutes
	3. Definition of the Market
	4. Time horizon
Price elasticity of demand = (Percentage change in quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in price)
The flatter is the demand curve that passes through a given point, the greater is the price elasticity of demand. The steeper is the demand curve that passes through a given point, the smaller is the price elasticity of demand.
Total revenue = the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good, computed as the price of the good times the quantity sold
Income Elasticity of Demand = a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income, computed as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in income
Income Elasticity of Demand = (Percentage change in quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in income)
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand = a measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good, computed as the percentage change in quantity of the first good divided by the percentage change in the price of the second good
Price Elasticity of Supply = a measure of how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price
