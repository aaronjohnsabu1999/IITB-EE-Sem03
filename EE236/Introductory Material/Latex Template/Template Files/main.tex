\section{Overview of the experiment} %[This segment creates Section as seen in document]

\subsection{Aim of the experiment}%[This segment creates sebsections under the same section]

In your own words, describe the aim of the experiment.

\subsection{Methods}




In your own words, describe how you set out to realize the goal of the experiment. Only 1 paragraph of a brief overview of your approach is expected here. Do not list your observations here.

\section{Design}%[To add multiple sections, keep appending blocks like this]

In this section, explain your design strategy for the experiment.Mention all the design steps you follow for each part of the experiment.An equation based analysis, with supporting circuit diagrams is expected. Circuit diagrams must be made in Xcircuit.
 
 \begin{equation}
     v_{o1}-v_{o2}
     \newline
     = -g_mR_D(v_{in1}-v_{in2})
 \end{equation}     
 
 \begin{equation}
     a=b+c
 \end{equation}     

 %equations are to inserted in this manner.
